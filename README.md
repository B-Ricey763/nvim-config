# nvim-config
My vimrc for neovim written in lua

It uses [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage nvim plugins, you have to install it manually.

Open nvim and run `:PackerSync` to get everything to work.

Make sure your font (I use Fira Code) has font ligatures enabled in order for the airline plugin to look cool.
